SAMPLE CODING ASSIGNMENT - CJay Castle

UPDATES
The slides work - very simple to do once I got home from camping last week!

Changed the color of the navbar.

Resolved the issue of the modal in a different way than I have used them before.
I think this is because I was working on a group project before and needed to create a 
certain look for the client that was better with partial views for each of several modals.

I had to move script references so that they could be read properly. 

I did not use so many of Html Helpers that I might use in a production environment.
In some interviews, they want to see that you know some basics. I have also been trained
in using the shorter syntax.

I tried out AutoMapper, which I have not used before. 

BTW, I really like to learn new things, but if there is a method that the team prefers to use,
I am definitely a junior member and look to learn from you! I learn very quickly.

TODO: Decide how to handle the Controller (I'm working on JQuery, AJAX to show what I was
trained to be able to do at The Software Guild.  Basic functioning to get data to
post into the db, should you wish to have me in for an interview.)

COMPONENTS IN THE FOLDER:
Database script for SQL Server
You would need to adjust the connection strings for your machine.
My experience is mainly with straight-up SQL Server and not with LocalDb.

The Project (Visual Studio 2015)

DOES IT PERFORM THE REQUIRED FUNCTIONALITY?
Not yet! I have the backend, most of the front end, and there is more work to do with getting data to the 
Controller and back into the database. There are various JavaScript tasks to attend to at this point.

I do not have as much experience designing a UI, so I did not manage to change the navbar color (I thought I had 
foudn the right CSS file to modify!) and incorporate the UMCU logo, but I will continue to tinker with this.

FEATURES
It has a basic MVC architecture, which you can see in action when you select the New Member Application.
There, I've used Bootstrap, obviously.

It is N-Tiered, but while I have separated concerns, used data annotations for some validation, I like to be very 
thorough with validation. I have not done any server-side validation besides the ViewModel data annotations.

I also started to make a modal that would appear when the Joint Account Holder information needs to be entered.

The Index page is going to have a background of cool sliding images. That's an eye-catching feature I like on many pages.

ROAD BLOCKS
I have used Visual Studio 2013 a lot but have been working with 2015 mostly. I wonder if some of my bugs have been from 
some different versions than I've been used to? 

Anyway, I left my JSON / JQuery work for last, and I did not show any, so if you invite me back, you will see that.
Thanks for the opporunity!
